# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. 
Key features include:
Readability: Clean and easy-to-read syntax.
Versatility: Supports multiple programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional).
Extensive Libraries: Large standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages.
Interpreted: Executes code line-by-line, which makes debugging easier.
Community Support: Strong community with extensive documentation and support.

Use cases where Python is particularly effective:
Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
Automation and Scripting: Automating repetitive tasks.
Scientific Computing: Libraries like SciPy and Matplotlib.


2. Installing Python:
Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

Windows:

Download Python installer from python.org.
Run the installer and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked.
Verify installation: Open Command Prompt and type python --version.
Install virtualenv: pip install virtualenv.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
print("Hello, World!")
print: Function used to output text to the console.
"Hello, World!": String literal enclosed in double quotes.

4. Data Types and Variables:
List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

Basic data types in Python:

int: Integer numbers (e.g., 5, -3).
float: Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.0).
str: Strings (e.g., "hello").
bool: Boolean values (True, False).
list: Ordered, mutable collections (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
dict: Key-value pairs (e.g., {"key": "value"}).

Variables of different data types
num = 10           # int
pi = 3.14          # float
name = "Alice"     # str
is_valid = True    # bool
numbers = [1, 2, 3]  # list
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}  # dict

print(num, pi, name, is_valid, numbers, person)


5. Control Structures:
Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an if-else statement and a for loop.

Conditional statements allow decision-making based on conditions. Loops enable repetitive execution of code.

if-else statement:

x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")
for loop:

for i in range(5):
    print(i)


6. Functions in Python:
What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are useful for code modularity and reusability.

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

Example of calling the function
result = add(3, 5)
print(result)   Output: 8

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

Lists: Ordered, mutable collections accessed by index.
Dictionaries: Unordered, mutable collections accessed by keys.

List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.append(6)  # Adding an element
print(numbers)

Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
person["city"] = "New York"  # Adding a key-value pair
print(person)


8. Exception Handling:
What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use try, except, and finally blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception handling manages errors gracefully during runtime.

try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")


9. Modules and Packages:
Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the math module.

Modules: Files containing Python code (functions, classes).
Packages: Directories containing multiple modules and an __init__.py file.
Example using math module:

import math

result = math.sqrt(16)
print(result)  # Output: 4.0


10. File I/O:
How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

Reading from a file:

with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a file:

lines = ["First line", "Second line", "Third line"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + '\n')


# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
